<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to work on a ModEX platform. The initial codebase was incomplete, requiring the user to upload missing frontend source files. The core tasks evolved through a series of requests:
1.  Set up and run the full-stack ModEX application.
2.  Perform comprehensive security hardening on the backend and frontend as directed by a series of security prompts (implementing RLS, HttpOnly cookies, server-side RBAC, etc.).
3.  Implement multiple branding updates, including logos, fonts, and favicons.
4.  Fix a critical bug where the home page was incorrectly redirecting to the sign-in page.
5.  Fix a persistent favicon caching issue.
6.  Add a complete set of official social media icons to the website's footer and a Follow Us section on the contact page.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A fully operational full-stack application (ModEX platform) built with React and FastAPI, using Supabase for the database, auth, and storage. The application has undergone significant security hardening, including a shift to HttpOnly cookie-based authentication, server-side role enforcement, and RLS policies on the database. The platform's branding (logos, favicon, fonts) has been updated as per user specifications. Social media icons have been added to the footer and are in the process of being verified for the contact page.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent was adding a complete set of 7 official social media icons to the Follow Us section on the  page, replacing the old placeholder icons. This was based on the user's request same to be done in follow us section and a clarifying screenshot they provided.
-   Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   Agent Testing Done: N (The agent applied the code changes and restarted the frontend, but a subsequent screenshot attempt failed. The code is expected to work, but visual confirmation is missing.)
-   Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool (Navigate to the  page to visually verify that all 7 social media icons are present and correct in the Follow Us section.)
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: Verify social media icons on the Contact page (P0)

Issues Detail:
-   Issue 1:
    -   Attempted fixes: The agent edited  to replace the old social icons with the new set of 7 icons from the  library. It then restarted the frontend service. The fix is implemented but has not been visually confirmed.
    -   Next debug checklist:
        1.  Use the screenshot tool to capture the  page.
        2.  Verify that the Follow Us section displays all 7 social icons (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Telegram).
        3.  If the icons are not present, review  to ensure the changes were saved correctly and check the browser console for any rendering errors.
    -   Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This will complete the user's request to have consistent social media branding across all relevant sections of the website.
    -   Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   Is recurring issue? N
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
    -   Blocked on other issue: None

    -   Configured and started services using .
-   **Initial Debugging:**
    -   Resolved missing Supabase credentials by obtaining them from the user and creating  files for both frontend and backend.
    -   Fixed a blank frontend page issue by ensuring Supabase environment variables were available to the React app and restarting the service.
-   **Comprehensive Security Hardening:**
    -   Implemented HttpOnly cookie-based authentication, removing all  token usage from the frontend ( and all API-calling pages).
    -   Enforced server-side admin role checks and secured CV download endpoints ().
    -   Separated Supabase clients into  and  to prevent unintended RLS bypass ().
    -   Added input validation (file type, size) and duplicate submission prevention for CV uploads ().
    -   Implemented a global Axios 401 interceptor on the frontend for clean session expiry handling ().
    -   Added lightweight rate limiting to critical backend endpoints (, ).
    -   Created a new SQL migration to enable and enforce RLS security policies ().
-   **Bug Fixes:**
    -   Resolved a critical issue where an aggressive Axios interceptor was redirecting all visitors to the sign-in page. The fix involved making the interceptor smarter to only act on failed requests for authenticated users.
    -   Fixed a persistent favicon caching issue by adding a version query parameter to the link in .
-   **Branding & UI Updates:**
    -   Updated the application's global font and color scheme ().
    -   Replaced the header logo and hero section logo with new assets (, ).
    -   Updated the favicon multiple times as requested by the user.
    -   Added a full set of 7 official social media icons to the site footer ().

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All issues raised by the user or identified by the agent during this session have been addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   Issue recurrence in previous fork: None
-   Recurrence count: 0
-   Status: NA

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS, Axios,  (for icons)
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic
-   **Database & BaaS:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
-   **Authentication:** HttpOnly cookie-based sessions (JWTs are stored in secure cookies, not ).
-   **Security:** Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase, Server-Side Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), CSRF protection (implied by cookie auth), rate limiting.

**key DB schema**
-   **profiles:** {user_id, full_name, email, is_admin, ...}
-   **cfo_applications:** {id, user_id, competition_id, cv_path, status, ...}
-   **competitions:** {id, title, description, start_date, end_date, ...}
-   **cfo_cvs (Storage Bucket):** Private bucket for storing CV files. Access is managed via signed URLs generated by the backend.

**changes in tech stack**
None. The existing stack (React, FastAPI, Supabase) was maintained.

**All files of reference**
*   : Recently edited to add social icons.
*   : Edited to add social icons to the footer and update the header logo.
*   : Heavily modified to implement cookie-based auth and a global 401 interceptor.
*   : Edited to update the favicon with a cache-busting parameter.
*   : Edited to add rate-limiting middleware.
*   : New file created to handle user session validation from cookies.
*   : Edited for security hardening and to use HttpOnly cookies for login/logout.
*   : Edited for security hardening (admin checks, signed URLs).
*   : New file created to enforce RLS policies.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The file  is over 400 lines long and contains the logic for the header, mobile navigation, and footer. It should be broken down into separate, more manageable components (e.g., , , ).

**key api endpoints**
-   : Authenticates user and sets HttpOnly cookie.
-   : Clears the HttpOnly session cookie.
-   : Retrieves current user profile based on session cookie.
-   : Securely uploads a user's CV.
-   : Admin-only endpoint to get a short-lived signed URL for a CV.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Authentication is Cookie-Based:** Do not use  or  headers on the frontend. The backend handles sessions via HttpOnly cookies. All authenticated requests rely on credentials being sent automatically by the browser.
-   **Favicon Caching:** Browser caching for favicons is aggressive. If updating the favicon, ensure you append a version query string (e.g., ) to the link in  to force a refresh.
-   **Component Structure:** The  component is monolithic and could benefit from refactoring into smaller, dedicated components for header, footer, etc.
